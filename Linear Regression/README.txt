All the instructions about the homework is given in HW1.ipynb file. For those of you who are not familiar with this type of files, it is a python notebook document, used mostly by Jupyter Notebook. In it, you can code python in cells, while you can also insert formatted texts and visualizations. 

For this homework, you are not going to create any additional code or report files. You are going to add all your work in the HW1.ipynb file. Necessary instructions are given in the notebook.

For this homework, you are going to use only the following libraries:

-numpy==1.21.5
-matplotlib==3.1.3
-pandas==1.0.1
-sklearn==0.22.1

The numbers after the '==' refers to the version. These versions work, however it probably works for the newer versions and some of the older versions as well. These versions are the ones we used to create the homework, and I suggest that you use these versions for compatibility while checking your homeworks, but if you'd like, you can try other versions as well.
chnage the name of your notebook file to your name and reg number. As usual, send the files to the class coordinator, she will zip them and send me a single compressed folder. work submitted past the deadline won't be accepted
